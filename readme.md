# Random Quote
Node Module, that gets a random quote of the day. Better than Hello World ;-)

## usage:

...js
const randomQuote = require('./index');
randomeQuote();

//  { quote: 'The best intelligence test is what we do with our leisure.',  author: 'Laurence J. Peter',   cat: 'best' }

const randomQuote = require('./index');
randomeQuote();


// { quote: 'People are pretty forgiving when it comes to other people\'s families. The only family that ever horrifies you is your own.',
//  author: 'Doug Coupland',  cat: 'family' }
